A new version of the R package `hyriskR` has been released. The objective is to jointly propagate randomness and imprecision in risk assessment models. Drastic formating from the old version named `HYRISK` has been done.
New developements on spatial modelling will be integrated in the future in this package. [More information here](https://github.com/anrhouses/hyriskR)
